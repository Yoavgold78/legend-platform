# Story 1.4: AuditsApp (Next.js + BE) Integration

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a **DevOps Engineer**,
I want to migrate the existing AuditsApp (Frontend & Backend) into the Monorepo and route its traffic through the API Gateway,
so that it becomes the first application fully integrated into the unified platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC4.1:** AuditsApp Backend code migrated to `apps/audits-be/` with complete directory structure (controllers, models, routes, middleware, config, package.json)

2. **AC4.2:** audits-be authentication middleware refactored:
   - Remove all Auth0 JWT validation logic (no more `express-oauth2-jwt-bearer` or `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` in backend)
   - Create new middleware `trustGateway.js` that extracts `x-user-id` header and attaches to `req.user = { auth0_sub: x-user-id }`
   - All routes use `trustGateway` middleware instead of Auth0 validation
   - If `x-user-id` header missing, return 401 with clear error message

3. **AC4.3:** audits-be MongoDB User queries use `auth0Id` field (verify existing model has this field per architecture)

4. **AC4.4:** audits-be configured as Private Service in render.yaml:
   - Type: `pserv` (Private Service)
   - Not publicly accessible
   - Environment variables: `MONGO_URI`, `NODE_ENV`, `CLOUDINARY_*` (no Auth0 vars needed)

5. **AC4.5:** API Gateway `AUDITS_BE_URL` environment variable set to audits-be internal Private Service URL

6. **AC4.6:** Gateway proxy route `/api/v1/audits/*` successfully routes to audits-be (verify proxy.js from Story 1-3 works with actual backend)

7. **AC4.7:** AuditsApp Frontend code migrated to `apps/shell/app/(main)/audits/`:
   - All page components (list, detail, create views)
   - All audit-specific components  
   - API client updated to call Gateway URLs (`/api/v1/audits/*` instead of old backend URL)

8. **AC4.8:** Shell navigation updated to include "Audits" link in shared nav (visible when user authenticated)

9. **AC4.9:** End-to-end flow works:
   - User logs into Shell (Auth0) from Story 1-2
   - User clicks "Audits" in navigation
   - Audits page loads, makes API call to `/api/v1/audits/my-audits` with Bearer token
   - Gateway validates token, adds `x-user-id` header, proxies to audits-be
   - audits-be trusts header, queries MongoDB by `auth0Id`, returns user's audits
   - Frontend displays audits list

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**From brownfield-architecture.md:**
- **Section 3 (Tech Stack):** AuditsApp uses Node.js + Express + Mongoose + MongoDB, already uses Auth0 (but validates directly - needs refactoring)
- **Section 5 (Component Architecture):** audits-be communicates with MongoDB and Cloudinary, assumes authentication handled by Gateway
- **Section 7 (Source Tree):** Frontend integrates natively into Shell at `app/(main)/audits/`, Backend at `apps/audits-be/` with controllers/models/routes structure
- **Section 11 (Security):** Backends trust `x-user-id` header from Gateway (only Gateway validates Auth0 tokens), backends are Private Services

**From tech-spec-epic-1.md:**
- **Detailed Design → Services:** audits-be responsibility: all business logic for Audits & Checklists, communicates with MongoDB/Cloudinary, assumes Gateway authentication
- **Data Models → User Model:** MongoDB User schema has `auth0Id` field (should be unique: true, index: true, sparse: true)
- **APIs → Backend Contracts:** Backends expect `x-user-id` header from Gateway containing `auth0_sub`
- **Security → Backend Trust:** Backends do NOT validate tokens directly; they trust Gateway's `x-user-id` header (only accepting requests from Gateway's private network)
- **Workflows → User Login Flow:** Shell → Gateway (validates token) → audits-be (trusts x-user-id header) → MongoDB query by auth0Id

**Key Constraints:**
- audits-be MUST NOT validate Auth0 tokens (Gateway does this)
- audits-be MUST be Private Service (not publicly accessible)
- Frontend MUST call Gateway URLs (`/api/v1/audits/*`), NOT direct backend URLs
- User identity linked via `auth0Id` field in MongoDB (must match `x-user-id` from Gateway)
- Cloudinary integration remains in audits-be (no changes needed)

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 1-3 (API Gateway - Central Token Validation) - Status: done**

- **Gateway Services Created**: API Gateway fully functional at `apps/api-gateway/` with Auth0 JWT validation, proxy routing, request tracing
- **Middleware Pattern Established**: requestId → auth (JWT validation) → addUserContext (extract sub) → proxy routes
- **Proxy Route Already Configured**: `apps/api-gateway/src/routes/proxy.js` has `/api/v1/audits/*` route with conditional setup (returns 503 when `AUDITS_BE_URL` not set, will proxy when set)
- **Headers Passed to Backends**: Gateway adds `x-user-id` (from token `sub` claim) and `x-request-id` (correlation ID) to all proxied requests
- **Testing Pattern**: Comprehensive test suite with unit tests (middleware) and integration tests (auth flows), all passing
- **Environment Variable Pattern**: Use `.env.template` for documentation, actual values in Render dashboard
- **Private Service URLs**: Backends deployed as Private Services have internal URLs like `https://service-name.onrender.com` (not public)

**Actions for Story 1-4:**
- **REUSE** existing Gateway proxy route - just need to set `AUDITS_BE_URL` environment variable
- **FOLLOW** Gateway's trust pattern: audits-be should trust `x-user-id` header, not validate tokens
- **FOLLOW** testing pattern: unit tests for new middleware, integration tests for routes, E2E for full flow
- **DEPLOY** audits-be as Private Service (like Gateway expects in architecture)

**Key Files to Reference:**
- `apps/api-gateway/src/middleware/addUserContext.js` - Pattern for extracting user ID from JWT and adding to request
- `apps/api-gateway/src/routes/proxy.js` - Proxy configuration (audits route already exists)
- `apps/api-gateway/.env.template` - Environment variable pattern

**Gotchas from Story 1-3 to Avoid:**
- Gateway's proxy route needs exact Private Service URL in `AUDITS_BE_URL` (get from Render after deployment)
- Path rewriting in proxy: Gateway routes `/api/v1/audits/*` but backend expects root paths (`/audits/*` or just `/*`) - verify proxy pathRewrite config
- CORS: audits-be must allow requests from Gateway (though Private Service network should handle this)
- Error handling: audits-be should return proper HTTP status codes (Gateway will proxy them to Shell)

**AuditsApp Frontend Migration (`apps/shell/app/(main)/audits/`):**

```
apps/shell/app/(main)/audits/
├── page.tsx             # Audits list view (main page)
├── [id]/
│   └── page.tsx         # Audit detail view

```

**Shell Navigation Update:**

```typescript
// apps/shell/app/(main)/layout.tsx
import { AssignmentIcon } from '@mui/icons-material';

const navItems = [
  { label: 'Audits', href: '/audits', icon: AssignmentIcon }, // NEW
  { label: 'Schedule', href: '/schedule', icon: CalendarIcon }, // Future Story 1-6
  // ... other nav items
];
```

**Alignment with Unified Structure:**
- ✅ Backend follows Monorepo pattern: `apps/audits-be/` as standalone service
- ✅ Frontend follows App Router pattern: `app/(main)/audits/` with nested routes
- ✅ Uses workspace packages: `@legend/types` for shared TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Follows coding standards: TypeScript for frontend, ESLint/Prettier from `packages/config`

**Detected Variances:**
- AuditsApp backend may have been using CommonJS (`require`) - should migrate to ES Modules (`import/export`) per coding standards [Section 9]
- Existing Auth0 validation middleware in audits-be conflicts with new trust pattern - must be removed completely
- Frontend may have hardcoded backend URL - must be updated to relative Gateway URLs

### Testing Strategy

**From tech-spec-epic-1.md Test Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests (Vitest):** `trustGateway` middleware, user lookup logic
- **Integration Tests:** Audit routes with mocked Gateway headers, MongoDB queries
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):** Full login → navigate to Audits → view audits flow

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **Unit: trustGateway Middleware**
   - ✅ Request with `x-user-id` header → `req.user.auth0_sub` populated
   - ✅ Request without `x-user-id` header → 401 error

2. **Integration: Audit Routes**
   - ✅ GET `/audits/my-audits` with `x-user-id` header → returns user's audits from MongoDB
   - ✅ User not found in MongoDB → returns 404 or empty list (depending on business logic)
   - ✅ GET `/audits/:id` → returns specific audit if user has access

3. **E2E: Full Flow (Playwright)**
   - ✅ User logs into Shell (Auth0)
   - ✅ User clicks "Audits" in navigation
   - ✅ Audits list page loads
   - ✅ API call to `/api/v1/audits/my-audits` visible in Network tab
   - ✅ Audits data displayed correctly
   - ✅ User can navigate to audit detail view

4. **Manual: Error Scenarios**
   - ✅ Gateway down → frontend shows error message
   - ✅ audits-be down → Gateway returns 502, frontend handles gracefully
   - ✅ Invalid Auth0 token → Gateway returns 401, Shell redirects to login

**Test Data:**
- Create test MongoDB database for Staging with sample audits, users, stores
- Test user with `auth0Id` matching Auth0 test account used in Shell login
